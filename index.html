               <h3>Pluto is not a PLANET</h2>
               <p>Pluto came into the lexicon in 1930 when astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovered it when searching for signs of a planet. It wasn't until the early 2000s that researchers began developing the qualifications for a celestial body to be considered a planet.
                    In 2006, the IAU voted that the definition of a planet relied on three specifications: 
                    It orbits around the sun
                    It has sufficient mass so that it becomes a nearly round shape
                    It has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit
                    IAU members also concurred that dwarf planets and planets are two distinct classifications. They determined the solar system contains eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
                    Pluto does not meet the third criteria because it is not gravitationally dominant, the Library of Congress reports. This means Pluto is classified as a dwarf planet rather than a major planet like its formerly assumed siblings.

               <h2>Too Short to be Normal is a Dwarf</h2>
               <p>Dwarf planets are smaller planets that do not meet all three categories of a planet. According to NASA, they are round in shape and orbit the sun, but don't clear their orbital path. There are currently five recognized dwarf planets in our solar system, listed here in order of closest proximity to the Earth:
                    Ceres: Located in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, discovered in 1801
                    Pluto: Located in the Kuiper Belt, discovered in 1930
                    Eris: Located in the Kuiper Belt, discovered in 2003
                    Makemake: Located in the Kuiper Belt, discovered in 2005
                    Haumea: Located in the Kuiper Belt, discovered in 2003
                    Controversial categories
                    While the IAU definition of planets remains the globally adopted one, that doesn't mean it's unanimously accepted. Some planetary experts dispute the 2006 vote, saying the definitions are arbitrary. In 2018, scientist Philip Metzger from the University of Central Florida published a study that suggested the standard for classifying planets is not scientifically sound. 
                    Metzger argues that planetary scientists use the word "planet" in a number of ways because it's a functionally useful term, and that a planet should be defined by its intrinsic properties rather than its orbit, which can change over time.
                    "It's more dynamic and alive than Mars," Metzger said in a UCF press release, referring to its underground ocean, multiple moons, organic compounds and multilayer atmosphere. "The only planet that has more complex geology is the Earth."
                    NASA's Alan Stern also disagrees with the IAU. In an interview with Forbes, he said all dwarf planets should be considered planets for a number of reasons—one being that the solar system contains so many asteroids that no celestial body has cleared the neighborhood of its orbit.

               <h2>Beautiful Anyway</h2>
               <p>NASA has now gone ahead and shared some rather jaw-dropping images of Pluto on its Instagram handle, that showcases the tiny celestial object in different shades of the rainbow.
               The imagery was captured by NASA’s New Horizons Space Probe which was launched from Earth on January 19, 2006. The colours you see aren’t the actual colours of this celestial object. Instead, these were added by the space probe to highlight the subtle differences between the planet’s distinct regions.
               The NASA post explains the contrasting differences between the regions, “Pluto has a  complex,, varied surface with jumbled mountains reminiscent of Europa, networks of carved-out valleys, old, heavily cratered terrain sitting right next to new smooth icy plains, and even what might be wind-blown dunes.”
               New Horizons space probe conducted a six-month flyby that deeply studied Pluto as well as its moons in 2015. The space probe is still active, however, now it continues to explore the solar system, deeper into the Kuiper Belt.
               The round planet-like object around the edge of our solar system has been surrounded by controversies for its planet status.
               In 2019, the International Astronomical Union reduced Pluto’s planetary status to a dwarf planet as it didn’t meet the three criteria that was laid down by the organisation to be called a full-sized planet -- it’s in an orbit around the Sun, has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a near-round shape), and has cleared the neighbourhood around the orbit. Pluto failed in the last criteria.
